There are files called ML_without_k-fold in two formats .ipynb and .py. Both the files have same content. To run .ipynb use jupyter and .py u can use regular python interpreters

If u want to show k-fold, then use k-fold_mean.py. We have used 5-fold method.

There is also a file called outlier_analysis.py. It shows how many outliers are there in each column.
